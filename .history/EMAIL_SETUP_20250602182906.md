# Email Setup for Custom Contact Form

The custom contact form has been implemented with multiple email sending options. Currently, it defaults to opening the user's default email client with a pre-filled message, but you can set up more sophisticated email sending by following these instructions.

## Current Functionality âœ…

- **Custom Contact Modal**: Beautifully designed form that matches the site aesthetic
- **Form Validation**: Required fields and proper validation
- **Mailto Fallback**: Opens email client with pre-filled message to both recipients
- **Professional Email Template**: Includes all form data, source tracking, and timestamp

## Email Recipients

All custom plan inquiries are sent to:
- `app@sixtyseconds.video`
- `andrew.bryce@sixtyseconds.video`

## Email Content Includes

- Contact details (name, email, company, phone)
- Detailed requirements description  
- Budget range and timeline
- Source tracking (Product Page - Custom Plan Section)
- Selected currency and billing period
- Timestamp of inquiry

## Enhanced Email Setup Options

### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended for Quick Setup)

1. Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a service and template
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id  
   EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id
   ```

### Option 2: SendGrid (Professional Email Service)

1. Sign up at [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@sixtyseconds.video
   ```

### Option 3: SMTP (Use your existing email provider)

Add these environment variables:
```
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@sixtyseconds.video  
SMTP_PASS=your_email_password
```

## Deployment

The API endpoint (`api/send-email.js`) is ready for:
- **Vercel**: Will work automatically
- **Netlify**: Deploy as Netlify Function
- **Other platforms**: May need adjustment

## Testing

1. Fill out the custom contact form
2. If API endpoint is not configured, it will:
   - Open your default email client
   - Pre-fill the email with all form data
   - Address to both recipients
3. If API endpoint is configured, it will send automatically

## Current Status

âœ… **Working Now**: Mailto functionality with professional email template
ðŸ”§ **Optional Enhancement**: API-based email sending for seamless UX

The form is fully functional and will reliably deliver inquiries to both email addresses!
